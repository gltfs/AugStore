# Configuration file for DICOM viewer screen configuration.
#
# Do not change files in the config/config directory. These are default template files.
# If you want to edit a configuration file, copy the default template file from the config/config
# directory to the config/local_config directory and modify the file copy.
#
# Please note that it is required to test any configuration changes. This is done by:
#
# 1. Export an examination and the DICOM viewer to a disk location.  
# 2. Run the viewer from the disk location and verify that the changes have taken effect.
#
# If the viewer doesn't start properly it is likely that the changes to the configuration 
# file were made incorrectly.
# To remedy such problems, remove the modified file from the config/local_config directory.
#
# If the default template files are corrupted, remove the entire config directory 
# including sub folders "config" and "local_config". 
# The folder structure will be re-created during the next export from IDS7.

#
# These X/Y configurations describes resolutions for which
# IDS is capable of determining the number of monitors (1 - 4).
# It also handles many other resolutions by conclusions from
# this data, but if there is trouble with a certain monitor,
# just add it to the configuration and it should work.
