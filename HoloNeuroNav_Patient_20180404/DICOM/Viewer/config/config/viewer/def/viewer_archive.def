# This file is used to configure to which online base folder archive
# retrieval should be done.
#
# The configuration should contain one set of configuration parameters
# for each WISE server in a multi-server system.
#
# Run 'wdump cfg SERVER_CONFIGURATION'  on the "home" WISE server host
# to investigate which WISE servers are currently used. The printout
# contains an unique id-string, named "id", for each server. This string
# is used as value for the "server_id" parameter in the configuration
# below.
#
# Run 'wdump bf' on each configured WISE sever to investigate what base
# folders the server has. The printout contains an unique id-string, named
# "id_string", for each base folder. This string is used as value for the
# "destination_base_folder" parameter in the configuration below.
