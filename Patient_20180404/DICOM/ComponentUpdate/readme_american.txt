       **********************************************

THIS FILE IS AUTOMATICALLY DISPLAYED IF THE SECTRA CD VIEWER
DETECTS THAT SOME WINDOWS COMPONENTS ARE NOT UP TO DATE.



For the Sectra CD Viewer to be able to run, it is necessary
that some Windows components are up-to-date with recent
versions.

Perform the following on steps to update the Windows
components:

1. Login on your computer as a user with administrator
   privileges.

2. Close all running programs.

3. Insert this CD into the CD-drive.

4. Select "Run..." from the Start menu.

5. Enter "D:\ComponentUpdate\ComponentUpdate.exe" in the
   displayed dialog. (Replace "D:" with the drive-letter
   of the CD-drive you inserted this CD into.)

6. Click "OK".

7. Follow the instructions of the update program. The update
   program might request you to restart the computer when it
   is done.

You can be logged in as your normal user when using the
Sectra CD Viewer after the component update has been
performed.
