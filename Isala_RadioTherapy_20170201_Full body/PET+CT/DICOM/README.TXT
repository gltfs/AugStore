The medium (CD/DVD/memory stick) contains the following folder structure:

1. Root directory
It contains all files for running the patient data burned on the medium with either the iQ-LITE viewer or from a web browser, including the manual. It also contains the 'DICOMDIR', the main table of the database.

2. DICOM
In this folder are saved the DICOM image data. A specific folder structure is used: Each study is filed in a separate folder which is comprised of individual folders for the different series that are included in the study. The series folders then contain the individual images.

3. IHE_PDI
This folder contains the 'BANNER.JPG', which is used as a label for both the iQ-LITE viewer and the top of the INDEX.HTM page. Further you will find here the html sub-pages for study level and series level as well as the individual images as JPEG. 

4. REPORTS
The DICOM structured reports in an html web view are stored here.

The medium (CD/DVD/memory stick) may include the iQ-LITE DICOM viewer version 2.8.0. The software runs on Microsoft(R) Windows(R) XP, Vista and Windows 7.

Information regarding the intended use of the software:

iQ-LITE is a portable media image viewer that enables the user to view, manipulate and print images which have been exported from an iQ-VIEW or iQ-VIEW PRO Workstation.
A copy of iQ-LITE is burned onto every patient CD/DVD and automatically opens when the medium is inserted into the computer’s CD/DVD drive with enabled auto-run function (not possible with memory stick).

iQ-LITE provides a convenient way for physicians and other medical professionals to copy and save patient studies/images processed by an iQ-VIEW / PRO Workstation. When providing copies of these studies to referring physicians and/or patients, iQ-LITE provides an integrated, simple way to view the information stored on the CD/DVD/memory stick - without the use of any 3rd party software. 

iQ-LITE is only permitted for diagnostic use if all applicable legal requirements in your country are met. Please consult your authorized local distributor before using the application for diagnostic purposes.
